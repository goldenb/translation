Native interface to SRILM.

Steps:

(1) make -C $JAVANLP_HOME/projects/mt/src/mt/srilm

Make sure libsrilm.so was created in $JAVANLP_HOME/projects/mt/src/mt/srilm.

(2) build javanlp

(3) Run java as follows:

$ java -DSRILM=true -Djava.library.path=$JAVANLP_HOME/projects/mt/src/mt/srilm [...]

Notes:

SRILM language models loaded through JNI are not loaded in JVM's heap
memory, so you do not have to consider LM sizes when setting -Xmx and
-Xms values.

If the program crashes with assert error in LHash.cc, it probably
means the LM you are trying to load has a very large vocabulary size. 
Fix: increase lm_end_sym_id in ../base/SRILanguageModel.java.
